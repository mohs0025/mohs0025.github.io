        <h2>About Me</h2>

            <img id="my-image" src="images/sara.jpg" alt="My picture when I graduated.">

        <p>My name is <strong>Sara Mohsenpour</strong>. I am Iranian citizen and started studying “<abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>” in May 2023 at Algonquinc College. 24 years ago I was studying agriculture and animal science at Urmia University. It was a very good job and had a very good income. The only downside was that I worked two days a week and I was free and bored the rest of the week. So I decided to do something completely different. That's how I got into publishing.</p>
        <p>When I was a kid, I never guessed that I would study and work on such irrelevant subjects someday. Back then, I only liked cows because they were so big and they made strange noises. The second thing I liked was sitting in the attic of my grandfather's house and reading old and strange stories. Now my life seems to be divided between cows and stories. </p>
        
        <h3>My Hobies</h3>
        <p>There are many things I like in this world, but I'll tell you just a few:</p>
        <ul class="square-list">
            <li>Painting on canvas</li>
            <li>Watching classic movies on holidays</li>
            <li>Eating chips with a lot of noise, when it's quiet everywhere.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Education Background, Work Experience, and Career Plan</h3>
        
        <p>As regards my education, I have a B.Sc. degree in Agricultural - Animal Science Engineering (2001). While I was a bachelor student, I began working part-time as a typist and continued to handle responsibilities in the printing business. Through that work, I acquired a range of experience and skills needed in the printing industry.Specifically, from 2002 through 2015 (when I started my own business), I handled the following positions:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>At Funoos Co. (Book Distribution Company):</strong> Project Manager<sup> (2002-2009)</sup> </li>
            <li><strong>At Caravan Books Publishing House:
                </strong></li>
        </ul>
            <ol>
                <li>Team management and working with in-house and freelance editors and production editors</li>
                <li>Art directing all the imprints of “Caravan Books Publishing House”</li>
                <li>Devising and managing the publishing schedule with utmost precision</li>
                <li>Jashne Kitab Magazine, executive Director</li>
                <li>Typesetting and designing numerous publications</li>
            </ol>
        
        

        <p>In 2015, after seven years in the publishing industry, I started my own publishing house, “Jica Books”. This became the next step in my career, and I have successfully acquired a range of experience related to the business.</p>
